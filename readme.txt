Task:
rotate banner every 2 seconds


Approach 1:

have 3 divs each with an inline style for a different backbround image that are targeted by class and toggle an "active" class to show/hide 


Approach 2:

having an array of images (image URLs), targeting one div and havin a function that changes the background image using JS, then hooking up this function in a setInterval function 

steps taken:
1. worked on HTML structure from approach #1 and restructired it according to the new functionality (ex. 1 div instead of 3 different divs for banner)

2. edited CSS to represent the banner

3. tested functionality of toggling background using background colors as a start
